## Abstract

In this paper, a Meta-cognitive Recurrent Fuzzy
Inference System is proposed where recurrence is brought using
Memory type Neurons (McRFIS-MN) to retain the effect of all
past instances, while the meta-cognition component is employed
to control the learning process, by deciding what-to-learn, whento-learn
and how-to-learn from the training data. The McRFISMN
model has five layers, and Memory Neurons (MN) are
employed only in the layers handling crisp values. The antecedent
parameters are set randomly while only the consequent weights
of the network are updated using a one-shot type projection
based learning algorithm through time (PBLT) which makes the
learning very fast. The performance evaluation of McRFIS-MN
has been carried out using benchmark problems in the areas of
nonlinear system identification and time-series forecasting. The
results are evaluated against some of the most popular neural
fuzzy methods and the obtained results indicate that McRFISMN
performs better in terms of speed while achieving better or
similar accuracy.
